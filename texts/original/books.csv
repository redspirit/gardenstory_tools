concord_journal0,Spring Hamlet,personal,Journals for Guardians,1,0,"Records of our history are plentiful within the Grove, but our own stories and truths are often left out. As a Guardian, I feel it important to explore qualities of my peers.  In my journal, I can highlight these MEMORIES to use in my daily life. Copying the practices of the others, I can explore more ways to empower myself. Some of the older Guardians will be resistant, but I remain eager to introduce my ideas to the others.",,,,,,,Revistas Para Guardianes,"Los registros de nuestra historia son abundantes en Grove, pero nuestras propias historias y verdades a menudo quedan fuera. Como tutor, creo que es importante explorar las cualidades de mis compañeros. En mi diario, puedo destacar estas MEMORIAS para usar en mi vida diaria.

I find that my personal experience with them is what best forms the foundation of how I proceed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
concord_journal2,Spring Hamlet,personal,Utilizing the Journal II,1,0,"After I get an idea of who they are, I like to write down things they do. The things they like, the things they dislike. The tasks that they work hardest. By practicing these things over time, I find that I have a better appreciation (and ability) for Guardians' place in the Grove.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
concord_stats0,Spring Hamlet,personal,Know Yourself! I,1,0,"Out of all qualities, a Guardian's body and thought are the most important.

Our prosperity has always been shared with the outer towns, making Spring Hamlet a popular destination for the weary and hurt of the Grove.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sprg_hist_b,Spring Hamlet,history,Birthplace: The Kindergarden,1,0,"In the early days, the first of us emerged from the Kindergarden, the everlasting vine. As with every birthplace, the Kindergarden shares kinship with the Grove itself, connecting us to the very Font that sustains us. What at one time was a neverending length winding through the Hamlet itself, the Kindergarden has receded. Now the vine sits silent, a reminder of a previous era.",,obj_firebloom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sprg_hist_c,Spring Hamlet,history,The Rot Descends,2,2,"It first came from Autumn Town, crawled down the steppes and wreaked havoc on our resources.

We never thought it'd reach us at the base of the Grove, but now even humble farmers are scared to work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sprg_hist_d,Spring Hamlet,history,An Age of Bravery,1,1,"Few dared to face our fetid foe face-to-face. However, those who stepped up and found victory against them gained favor quickly.

Our soil is the most fertile, lands brimming with material ready for plucking. If the Hamlet is the heart of the Grove, the rivers are our veins, pushing our abundance of Dew to every corner of the Grove. What the local forage lacks in sturdiness and size, they make up for in flexibility and variety of use.",,obj_pillar_spr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sprg_ecgl_c,Spring Hamlet,ecology,Rot Temperament,1,1,"The Rot of Spring Hamlet seems much more docile than the variations beyond the village's circle.

sprg_study_b,Spring Hamlet,study,Dew Cleansing,1,0,"The rivers play an important role in Dew dispersion, but can often taint our lifesource with impurities.

However, as I've seen during harsher months, even small amounts of stress cause strife between them. While their immediate needs are met, each villager struggles with their own personal issues. Villagers are highly social, and as such, stresses can have compounding effects in this tight community.",,obj_lamp_spr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sprg_cltr_b,Spring Hamlet,culture,Vital Exchange,1,0,"As the Grove's greenest locale and central location, the Hamlet is the heart of trade between towns.

Without them, each town would stagnate and suffer economically and culturally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sprg_cltr_c,Spring Hamlet,culture,Guardian Plum,1,0,"A stalwart pillar of the community, Plum rarely leaves the Hamlet. True to their hometown, Plum has shirked the inter-town tendencies of the other Guardians, choosing instead to extend help to the Hamlet's many villagers.

smr_hist_a,Summer Bar,history,Aquatic Ancestry,1,0,"The Summer Bar was first pioneered by various Seafolk.

They conducted small trade through any Frog brave enough to interact with them.",,obj_unb_bell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
smr_hist_b,Summer Bar,history,A New Horizon,1,0,"From afar, the Guardians of the Grove inspired us, and many sought to expand their horizons beyond the sand.

smr_hist_c,Summer Bar,history,An Abrupt End,1,0,"Just as Vista Outpost began to flourish, the Guardians' Maiden Voyage never returned. Many of the Greenlings who started the Outpost left.

Only our most agile dowsers are able to manipulate our many underwater contraptions fast enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
smr_stdy_b,Summer Bar,study,Birthplace: The Sea,1,0,"Seafolk are aquatic animals that have gained sentience through coming into contact with the life-sustaining Dew within the Grove.

smr_culture_b,Summer Bar,culture,Guardian: Blue,1,0,"As Blue was a conglomeration of organisms, many relations were drawn between our Guardian and the encroaching Rot found in Autumn Town.

atm_study_c,Autumn Town,ecology,Reclamation through Rot,1,0,"Most of what grows here doesn't live long. The ground is too dry. But we've found ways to adapt.

Even without the voice of the Grove, we can thrive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
atm_study_d,Autumn Town,ecology,Ooze Behavior,1,0,"Our town has flourished. These lands were rife with challenging conditions, yet we have created an endless bounty of gardened goods the entire Grove.

Who knows what wonders it will perform on our island? ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
atm_study_e,Autumn Town,ecology,Rot: Hay Mimic,1,0,"As the villagers got more and more aggressive against the Sewer's Oozes, the Rot began to hide within the wheat they eat. Some even donned it as both a protective shield and a disguise among the overgrown fields of Autumn Town.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

atm_hist_a,Autumn Town,history,The First True Town,1,0,"When the first of our pioneers left Spring Hamlet, they turned their backs on the luxury it offered. They welcomed hardship with open arms, and so soon did their pilgrimage bear harvest. Autumn Town was born from the harsh environment, its sturdy forage inspiring a feat of architecture that no other village in the Grove would rival.",,obj_chair_atm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
atm_hist_b,Autumn Town,history,An Autumn Age,1,0,"In our new environment, we found weeds. Now, we grow crops essential to the entire Grove. Through selective propagation, we created crops more capable of resisting the harsh winds, materials harder than anything grown before.

We'll bide our time on the foundations of Autumn Town until we can find a way to fix our home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
atm_hist_f,Autumn Town,history,The Final Collapse,1,0,"Autumn Town is gone. Most of it, anyways. The Grove's root, which once cradled and embraced our city, gave way to the Rot. Most of Autumn Town sank away into the sea. I take solace only in the fact that almost everyone was able to get somewhere safe, and those who fled to the steps of the city still cling to the dream-come-true that was our beautiful town.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

atm_culture_a,Autumn Town,culture,Merchant-Grower Society,1,0,"Though most in the early days of Autumn Town lived to spite the Hamlet's easy-going culture, it soon became clear that they'd have to trade with the other towns to survive. Autumn Town grew what others could not, and they soon relied on a complex import-export relationship with the rest of the Grove.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
atm_culture_b,Autumn Town,culture,Leaflet Minting,1,0,"To tally their contributions and debts, the villagers of Autumn Town created a currency. Though previously unused in a mainly barter-centric Grove, it soon became a coveted resource for trade. Unfortunately, the Rot's fascination with the shiny coins meant they would need to continually mint the currency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
atm_culture_c,Autumn Town,culture,Morbid Thought,1,0,"While many Greenling were horrified by the Rot's ability to consume plants, many were resigned to continue Rot cultivation in order to keep Autumn Town growing.

wtr_study_c,Winter Thicket,study,Shooting Stars,1,0,"Not much can be translated from the old relics of the Mists.

wtr_culture_a,Winter Thicket,culture,The Few,1,0,"As the smallest community, Winter Glade is proud. All villagers maintain a strong interpersonal relationship with each other.

wtr_hist_e,Winter Thicket,history,Old Beliefs,1,0,"While the Grove waned more and more, our people became desparate for a solution. Our scribes pored endlessly over the Old World's texts. Finally, Ledidi came forward with an idea: secure another source of Mana for the Grove. So we all set out for the Summer Bar to develop new watercraft and sailing technology.
